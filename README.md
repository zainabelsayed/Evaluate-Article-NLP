# How It Works:
## Simpliy it is an article evaluate application using the NLP(Natural Language Processing). 
## To evaluate the article just add the article URL you want to evaluate in the input field and press submit.
## that will fetch the <a href="https://www.meaningcloud.com/">Meaning Cloud API</a> that will evaluate the article using the Natural Language Processing.
## Then the Results will be shown in the form results field.
## In this Application I have used WebPack build tool and I have worked on the WebPack configartion in the development and production modes 
## Also I have used Express.js to retrive data from the API and post it to the Client
## And I have worked with JavaScript and Saas

# The Application UI
